**TO:** {provider.email}
**FROM:** support@mobilephlebotomy.org
**SUBJECT:** Your MobilePhlebotomy.org Listing Is Live

---

## Email Content:

Hi {provider.contact_name},

Your business, **{provider.business_name}**, is now live on MobilePhlebotomy.org and visible to patients searching for mobile blood draw services in your area.

### Your Listing

**Profile**: https://www.mobilephlebotomy.org/provider/{provider.slug}

**Service Area**: {coverage_cities_list}
**Services**: {services_list}

### How Patient Requests Are Routed

Patients can submit requests directly through MobilePhlebotomy.org.

To receive automated email/SMS notifications when a request matches your coverage area, you'll need to complete provider onboarding here:

👉 **https://www.mobilephlebotomy.org/onboard**

**Once onboarded:**
- You'll be notified when requests match your service area
- Timely acknowledgment helps confirm availability and keeps response times tight
- If you're unavailable, a quick reply allows us to reroute without patient delay

If you choose not to onboard, your listing will still be visible, but lead notifications are not automatically sent.

### Visibility & Placement

Your listing appears in:
- City and metro-area search results
- Service-based searches (e.g., mobile blood draws at home)
- Nearby community directories

Some providers are invited to participate in featured placement pilots, which offer priority routing and enhanced visibility as local request volume increases.

### Keeping Your Listing Accurate

To update your listing, email **hector@mobilephlebotomy.org** with:
- Coverage area changes
- Updated hours or services
- New contact information
- Logo or photos

Updates are typically processed within 24 hours.
